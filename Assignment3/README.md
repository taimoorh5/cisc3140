Assignment 3
Api Client

Coded in python using flask. Parses the top headlined article in the United States from NewsApi.
The same api we are planning to use for our group project. The data I chose to parse was the title,
date and time published, image, description, and a link to the article. Data is displayed locally
using HTML.
